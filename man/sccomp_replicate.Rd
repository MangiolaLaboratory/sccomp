\usage{
sccomp_replicate(
  fit,
  formula_composition = NULL,
  formula_variability = NULL,
  number_of_draws = 1,
  mcmc_seed = sample(1e+05, 1)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{The result of sccomp_estimate.}

\item{formula_composition}{A formula. The formula describing the model for differential abundance, for example ~treatment. This formula can be a sub-formula of your estimated model; in this case all other factor will be factored out.}

\item{formula_variability}{A formula. The formula describing the model for differential variability, for example ~treatment. In most cases, if differentially variability is of interest, the formula should only include the factor of interest as a large anount of data is needed to define variability depending to each factors. This formula can be a sub-formula of your estimated model; in this case all other factor will be factored out.}

\item{number_of_draws}{An integer. How may copies of the data you want to draw from the model joint posterior distribution.}

\item{mcmc_seed}{An integer. Used for Markov-chain Monte Carlo reproducibility. By default a random number is sampled from 1 to 999999. This itself can be controlled by set.seed()}
