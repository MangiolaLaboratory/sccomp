\title{Clear Stan Model Cache}
\usage{
clear_stan_model_cache(cache_dir = sccomp_stan_models_cache_dir)
}
\arguments{
\item{cache_dir}{A character string representing the path of the cache directory to delete.
Defaults to \code{sccomp_stan_models_cache_dir}, which is the default cache location used by sccomp.}
}
\value{
NULL invisibly. The function is called for its side effect of removing the cache directory.
}
\description{
This function removes the Stan model cache directory and all its contents. The cache is used by cmdstanr to store compiled Stan models.
Clearing the cache can be useful when:
\itemize{
\item You're experiencing issues with cached models
\item You want to force recompilation of models
\item You're switching between different versions of Stan
}
}
\details{
The function uses \code{unlink()} with \code{recursive = TRUE} to remove the directory and all its contents.
If the cache directory doesn't exist, the function will simply print a message and continue.
This is a safe operation as cmdstanr will recreate the cache directory when needed.
}
\examples{
# Clear the default sccomp cache directory
clear_stan_model_cache()

# Clear a specific cache directory
clear_stan_model_cache("path/to/custom/cache")

# Example of when you might want to clear the cache
\dontrun{
# If you're experiencing issues with model compilation
clear_stan_model_cache()
# Then try running your model again
}
