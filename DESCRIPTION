Title: Robust Outlier-aware Estimation of Composition and Heterogeneity for Single-cell Data
Version: 2.1.1
Authors@R: c(person("Stefano", "Mangiola", email = "mangiolastefano@gmail.com",

Description: A robust and outlier-aware method for testing differential tissue composition from single-cell data. This model can infer changes in tissue composition and heterogeneity, and can produce realistic data simulations based on any existing dataset. This model can also transfer knowledge from a large set of integrated datasets to increase accuracy further.
