Description: A robust and outlier-aware method for testing differential tissue composition from single-cell data. This model can infer changes in tissue composition and heterogeneity, and can produce realistic data simulations based on any existing dataset. This model can also transfer knowledge from a large set of integrated datasets to increase accuracy further.
