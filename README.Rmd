Cellular omics such as single-cell genomics, proteomics, and microbiomics allow the characterization of tissue and microbial community composition, which can be compared between conditions to identify biological drivers. This strategy has been critical to unveiling markers of disease progression in conditions such as cancer and pathogen infections.

For cellular omic data, no method for differential variability analysis exists, and methods for differential composition analysis only take a few fundamental data properties into account. Here we introduce **sccomp**, a generalised method for differential composition and variability analyses capable of jointly modelling data count distribution, compositionality, group-specific variability, and proportion mean-variability association, while being robust to outliers.

**sccomp** is an extensive analysis framework that allows realistic data simulation and cross-study knowledge transfer. We demonstrate that mean-variability association is ubiquitous across technologies, highlighting the inadequacy of the very popular Dirichlet-multinomial modeling and providing essential principles for differential variability analysis.

### Comparison with other methods

- **I**: Data are modelled as counts.
- **II**: Group proportions are modelled as compositional.
- **III**: The proportion variability is modelled as cell-type specific.
- **IV**: Information sharing across cell types, mean–variability association.
- **V**: Outlier detection or robustness.
- **VI**: Differential variability analysis.

## The old framework

The new tidy framework was introduced in 2024, two, understand the differences and improvements. Compared to the old framework, please read this [blog post](https://tidyomics.github.io/tidyomicsBlog/post/2023-12-07-tidy-sccomp/).
