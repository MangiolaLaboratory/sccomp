Cellular omics such as single-cell genomics, proteomics, and
microbiomics allow the characterization of tissue and microbial
community composition, which can be compared between conditions to
identify biological drivers. This strategy has been critical to
unveiling markers of disease progression in conditions such as cancer
and pathogen infections.

For cellular omic data, no method for differential variability analysis
exists, and methods for differential composition analysis only take a
few fundamental data properties into account. Here we introduce
**sccomp**, a generalised method for differential composition and
variability analyses capable of jointly modelling data count
distribution, compositionality, group-specific variability, and
proportion mean-variability association, while being robust to outliers.

**sccomp** is an extensive analysis framework that allows realistic data
simulation and cross-study knowledge transfer. We demonstrate that
mean-variability association is ubiquitous across technologies,
highlighting the inadequacy of the very popular Dirichlet-multinomial
modeling and providing essential principles for differential variability
analysis.

### Comparison with other methods

- **I**: Data are modelled as counts.
- **II**: Group proportions are modelled as compositional.
- **III**: The proportion variability is modelled as cell-type specific.
- **IV**: Information sharing across cell types, mean–variability
  association.
- **V**: Outlier detection or robustness.
- **VI**: Differential variability analysis.
- **VII** Mixed effect modelling

`sccomp` tests differences in cell type proportions from single-cell
data. It is robust against outliers, it models continuous and discrete
factors, and capable of random-effect/intercept modelling.

## Characteristics

- Complex linear models with continuous and categorical covariates
- Multilevel modelling, with population fixed and random
  effects/intercept
- Modelling data from counts
- Testing differences in cell-type proportionality
- Testing differences in cell-type specific variability
- Cell-type information share for variability adaptive shrinkage
- Testing differential variability
- Probabilistic outlier identification
- Cross-dataset learning (hyperpriors).

# Installation

`sccomp` is based on `cmdstanr` which provides the latest version of
`cmdstan` the Bayesian modelling tool. `cmdstanr` is not on CRAN, so we
need to have 3 simple step process (that will be prompted to the user is
forgot).

1.  R installation of `sccomp`
2.  R installation of `cmdstanr`
3.  `cmdstanr` call to `cmdstan` installation

**Bioconductor**

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager")) install.packages("BiocManager")

# Step 1
BiocManager::install("sccomp")

# Step 2
install.packages("cmdstanr", repos = c("https://stan-dev.r-universe.dev/", getOption("repos")))

# Step 3
cmdstanr::check_cmdstan_toolchain(fix = TRUE) # Just checking system setting
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
```

**Github**

``` r
# Step 1
devtools::install_github("MangiolaLaboratory/sccomp")

# Step 2
install.packages("cmdstanr", repos = c("https://stan-dev.r-universe.dev/", getOption("repos")))

# Step 3
cmdstanr::check_cmdstan_toolchain(fix = TRUE) # Just checking system setting
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
```

# Analysis

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(sccomp)
library(ggplot2)
library(forcats)
library(tidyr)
data("seurat_obj")
data("sce_obj")
data("counts_obj")
```

`sccomp` can model changes in composition and variability. By default,
the formula for variability is either `~1`, which assumes that the
cell-group variability is independent of any covariate or
`~ factor_of_interest`, which assumes that the model is dependent on the
factor of interest only. The variability model must be a subset of the
model for composition.

## Binary factor

Of the output table, the estimate columns start with the prefix `c_`
indicate `composition`, or with `v_` indicate `variability` (when
formula_variability is set).

### From Seurat, SingleCellExperiment, metadata objects

``` r
sccomp_result = 
  sce_obj |>
  sccomp_estimate( 
    formula_composition = ~ type, 
    sample = "sample", 
    cell_group = "cell_group", 
    cores = 1 
  ) |> 
  sccomp_test()
```

### From counts

``` r
sccomp_result = 
  counts_obj |>
  sccomp_estimate( 
    formula_composition = ~ type, 
    sample = "sample",
    cell_group = "cell_group",
    abundance = "count", 
    cores = 1, verbose = FALSE
  ) |> 
  sccomp_test()
```

Here you see the results of the fit, the effects of the factor on
composition and variability. You also can see the uncertainty around
those effects.

The output is a tibble containing the **Following columns**

- `cell_group` - The cell groups being tested.
- `parameter` - The parameter being estimated from the design matrix
  described by the input `formula_composition` and
  `formula_variability`.
- `factor` - The covariate factor in the formula, if applicable (e.g.,
  not present for Intercept or contrasts).
- `c_lower` - Lower (2.5%) quantile of the posterior distribution for a
  composition (c) parameter.
- `c_effect` - Mean of the posterior distribution for a composition (c)
  parameter.
- `c_upper` - Upper (97.5%) quantile of the posterior distribution for a
  composition (c) parameter.
- `c_pH0` - Probability of the null hypothesis (no difference) for a
  composition (c). This is not a p-value.
- `c_FDR` - False-discovery rate of the null hypothesis for a
  composition (c).
- `v_lower` - Lower (2.5%) quantile of the posterior distribution for a
  variability (v) parameter.
- `v_effect` - Mean of the posterior distribution for a variability (v)
  parameter.
- `v_upper` - Upper (97.5%) quantile of the posterior distribution for a
  variability (v) parameter.
- `v_pH0` - Probability of the null hypothesis for a variability (v).
- `v_FDR` - False-discovery rate of the null hypothesis for a
  variability (v).

    formula_composition = ~ type, 
    sample = "sample",

## Summary plots

A plot of group proportions, faceted by groups. The blue boxplots
represent the posterior predictive check. If the model is descriptively
adequate for the data, the blue boxplots should roughly overlay the
black boxplots, which represent the observed data. The outliers are
coloured in red. A boxplot will be returned for every (discrete)
covariate present in formula_composition. The colour coding represents
the significant associations for composition and/or variability.

``` r
sccomp_result |> 
  sccomp_boxplot(factor = "type")
```

    ## sccomp says: When visualising proportions, especially for complex models, consider setting `remove_unwanted_effects=TRUE`. This will adjust the proportions, preserving only the observed effect.

We can plot the relationship between abundance and variability. As we
can see below, they are positively correlated. sccomp models this
relationship to obtain a shrinkage effect on the estimates of both the
abundance and the variability. This shrinkage is adaptive as it is
modelled jointly, thanks to Bayesian inference.

## Model proportions directly (e.g. from deconvolution)

**Note:** If counts are available, we strongly discourage the use of
proportions, as an important source of uncertainty (i.e., for rare
groups/cell types) is not modeled.

The use of proportions is better suited for modelling deconvolution
results (e.g., of bulk RNA data), in which case counts are not
available.

Proportions should be greater than 0. Assuming that zeros derive from a
precision threshold (e.g., deconvolution), zeros are converted to the
smallest non-zero value.

``` r
sccomp_result = 
  counts_obj |>
  sccomp_estimate( 
    formula_composition = ~ type, 
    sample = "sample",
    cell_group = "cell_group",
    abundance = "proportion", 
    cores = 1, verbose = FALSE
  ) |> 
  sccomp_test()
```

## Continuous factor

`sccomp` is able to fit arbitrary complex models. In this example we
have a continuous and binary covariate.

``` r
res =
    seurat_obj |>
    sccomp_estimate(
      formula_composition = ~ type + continuous_covariate, 
      sample = "sample", 
      cell_group = "cell_group",
      cores = 1, verbose=FALSE
    )
```

    ## Loading required namespace: SeuratObject

    ## sccomp says: count column is an integer. The sum-constrained beta binomial model will be used

## Random Effect Modeling (mixed-effect modeling, multilevel-modeling, hierarchical modeling)

`sccomp` supports multilevel modeling by allowing the inclusion of
random effects in the compositional and variability formulas. This is
particularly useful when your data has hierarchical or grouped
structures, such as measurements nested within subjects, batches, or
experimental units. By incorporating random effects, sccomp can account
for variability at different levels of your data, improving model fit
and inference accuracy.

### Random Intercept Model

In this example, we demonstrate how to fit a random intercept model
using sccomp. We’ll model the cell-type proportions with both fixed
effects (e.g., treatment) and random effects (e.g., subject-specific
variability).

Here is the input data

### Nested Random Effects

If you have a more complex hierarchy, such as measurements nested within
subjects and subjects nested within batches, you can include multiple
grouping variables. Here `group2__` is nested within `group__`.

``` r
res = 
  seurat_obj |>
  sccomp_estimate(
      formula_composition = ~ type + (type | group__) + (1 | group2__),
      sample = "sample",
      cell_group = "cell_group",
      bimodal_mean_variability_association = TRUE,
      cores = 1, verbose = FALSE
    )
```

## An aid to result interpretation and communication

The estimated effects are expressed in the unconstrained space of the
parameters, similar to differential expression analysis that expresses
changes in terms of log fold change. However, for differences in
proportion, logit fold change must be used, which is harder to interpret
and understand.

Therefore, we provide a more intuitive proportional fold change that can
be more easily understood. However, these cannot be used to infer
significance (use sccomp_test() instead), and a lot of care must be
taken given the nonlinearity of these measures (a 1-fold increase from
0.0001 to 0.0002 carries a different weight than a 1-fold increase from
0.4 to 0.8).

From your estimates, you can specify which effects you are interested in
(this can be a subset of the full model if you wish to exclude unwanted
effects), and the two points you would like to compare.

In the case of a categorical variable, the starting and ending points
are categories.

``` r
sccomp_result |> 
   sccomp_proportional_fold_change(
     formula_composition = ~  type,
     from =  "benign", 
     to = "cancer"
    ) |> 
  select(cell_group, statement)

## Categorical factor (e.g. Bayesian ANOVA)

This is achieved through model comparison with `loo`. In the following
example, the model with association with factors better fits the data
compared to the baseline model with no factor association. For model
comparisons `sccomp_remove_outliers()` must not be executed as the
leave-one-out must work with the same amount of data, while outlier
elimination does not guarantee it.

If `elpd_diff`

The new tidy framework was introduced in 2024. To understand the
differences and improvements compared to the old framework, please read
